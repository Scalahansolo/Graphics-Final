Graphics-Final
==============

This was my final projects for my computer graphics class. I replicated New Belgium's shift logo and animated the gears and the chain.

### Notes:

- In order to run. Just use `make` and then run ./shift. 
- There might be issues if running on a non-ubuntu machine as my make file was made for an ubuntu 14.04 machine.
